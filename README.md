# zmk-config

This repository contains my zmk configurations.

Skeletyl config is forked from [0xcharly](https://github.com/0xcharly/zmk-config), keymap still work in progress.

Charybdis config is inspired by the one from [eigatech](https://github.com/eigatech/zmk-config) and others that made a Charybdis config


Keymap is definitely not final.
